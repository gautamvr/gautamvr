# Hi, Iâ€™m Gautam! ðŸ‘‹ 

**I'm currently a Senior Software Developer based in Bangalore, India - involved in development and providing solutions on Healthcare applications.**

In my part time, I keep engaging myself with projects regularly to learn and keep myself updated on various technologies. I've built projects from AI applications to cloud native applications with AWS Stack.

*Please do check out my Repos for few of the interesting projects that I've built.*

 I'm looking to collaborate on building more projects involving scalable cloud native applications and/or innovative deep learning projects.
